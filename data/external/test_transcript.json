Once you become a two-planet species, you can extend life paths to the asteroid belt and possibly to the moons of Jupiter and Saturn, ultimately reaching other star systems. However, if you can't even get to another planet, you're definitely not getting to other star systems. Another potential great filter is super powerful technology, like AGI. You're essentially trying to overcome one great filter at a time. Digital superintelligence could be a great filter; I hope it isn't, but it might be. Experts like Jeff Hinton have contributed significantly to this field."

        "text": "Key principles in artificial intelligence suggest that the probability of AI annihilation is estimated to be around 10 to 20%. While this indicates a significant risk, it also means there is an 80% likelihood that AI will be beneficial. However, I believe AI risk mitigation is crucial. Embracing a multi-species approach could serve as a substantial risk mitigation strategy. \n\nI want to emphasize the importance of having enough children to sustain our population numbers and avoid a potential collapse, which is a real and pressing issue. The only reason this situation is not being addressed more prominently is..."

        "text": "The total population numbers reflect that people are living longer. It's easy to predict the population of any given country: you take the birth rate from last year, see how many births occurred, and multiply that by life expectancy. This gives you the population in a steady state, assuming the birth rate remains constant. However, if the birth rate continues to decline, the population will decrease even further and could eventually dwindle to nothing. I emphasize the importance of addressing birth rates because this issue has historically been a source of civilizational collapse. So, why don't we work towards stabilizing the situation?"

I need to allocate more resources to the whole process, but apparently, it's not that difficult. It's like unskilled labor. One of the things you do for the world is inspire us with what the future could be. We've talked about some of the things you're building, such as alleviating human suffering with Neuralink, expanding the capabilities of the human mind, and trying to build a colony on Mars. This would create a backup for humanity on another planet."

Thank you for building the future and inspiring so many of us, including kids, to keep creating. \n\nYou're welcome. Go forth and multiply. \n\nThank you, Yan. Thanks for talking, brother. \n\nNow, dear friends, here's DJ, the co-founder, president, and CEO of Neuralink. When did you first become fascinated by the human brain? For me, I..."

For example, we discussed your curtain holders; they serve a clear purpose and were designed with that in mind. Growing up, I had a strong interest in seeing, touching, and feeling things to understand how they were designed to fulfill their functions. The brain is a fascinating organ that we all possess; it is an infinitely powerful machine from which intelligence and cognition arise. We haven't even scratched the surface of understanding it."

One significant moment was growing up with both sides of my family, where my grandparents suffered from a severe form of Alzheimer's. It's an incredibly debilitating condition, and I witnessed someone's entire identity and mind deteriorating over time. I remember thinking about the power of the mind and its fragility."

        "text": "It's fascinating how losing a sense of identity can reveal the power of the brain. Much of what we know about the brain comes from cases of trauma that result in the loss of certain abilities. These cases help us understand the critical functions of specific brain tissues. The brain is an incredibly fragile organ, yet it is also remarkably plastic and resilient. The term \"plastic\" refers to its adaptability."

Another key moment that influenced the trajectory of my life occurred during my teenage years when I came to the U.S. I didn't speak a word of English, which created a significant language barrier. I struggled to connect with my peers because I didn't understand the artificial construct of language, specifically English in this case. I remember feeling isolated and unable to connect with those around me, so I spent a lot of time on my own, reading books and watching movies. I naturally gravitated towards these activities."

Some of the first books I picked up were \"Ender's Game\" and the entire saga by Orson Scott Card, as well as \"Neuromancer\" by William Gibson and \"Snow Crash\" by Neal Stephenson. Movies like \"The Matrix\" were also coming out around that time, which influenced my thoughts on the potential impact of technology on our lives. Fast forward to my college years, I was always fascinated by building physical things, especially those with some form of intelligence. I studied electrical engineering during my undergraduate studies."
