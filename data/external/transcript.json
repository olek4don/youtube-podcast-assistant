Can you clarify if there's a difference between imagined movement and attempted movement? \n\nYes, in imagined movement, you're not actually attempting to move at all; you're visualizing the action. Theoretically, is there a different part of the brain that activates in these two situations? \n\nNot necessarily. I think all these signals can still be represented in the motor cortex. The difference seems to relate to the naturalness of imagining something versus attempting it, as well as the fatigue that can occur over time. By the way, the mic is bliss.",

However, I worry that if I indulge too much, I might gain weight, which would be unfortunate. I also want to beat Bliss at chess on a physical board. There are so many upsides to these interactions. I want to find ways to connect with Bliss and bring him down to my level because he is such an amazing person, and everything about him is exceptional. Anything I can do to humble him a bit, I'm happy to do. As he's sitting next to me, did you ever make sense of why God puts good people in challenging situations?",

If we were all happy all the time, there would be no reason to turn to God, and the concepts of good and bad would lose their meaning. The darkness and evil in the world help us appreciate the good and the things we have much more.

In contrast, someone else believes that this experience proves there isn't a God. I see it differently; I believe it is a way for God to test us, build our character, and guide us through trials and tribulations. These challenges help us appreciate how precious He is, the gifts He has given us, and the time we have. Ultimately, I hope we can grow from these experiences, as that is a significant part of our journey here.",

What gives me hope about our civilization is the people. Even during my few months at Neuralink, looking people in the eyes and hearing their motivations has been incredibly inspiring. They could be in cushier jobs elsewhere, doing things that don't mean much, but instead, they're here because they want to better humanity.",

They see someone like me and think, \"I can do something about that,\" and they take action. I've always connected most with people; I'm a people person. I love learning about others, their development, and their backgrounds. It's inspiring to see how much people are willing to do for someone like me, even when they don't have to. Their efforts to improve my life give me a lot of hope for humanity, showing how much we care and what we are capable of when we come together.",

The martyrs go hand in hand into the arena, but they are crucified alone. Embracing lovers desperately try to fuse their insulated ecstasies into a single self, seeking transcendence in vain. By its very nature, every embodied spirit is doomed to suffer and enjoy its solitude. Sensations, feelings, insights, and fancies are all private and, except through symbols, incommunicable. We can share information about experiences, but never the experiences themselves. From family to nation, every human group is a society of island universes. Thank you for listening.",
